Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?
Software is a program or a set of instruction that guide a computer on how to do a task.
Engineering is the process of of designing and building something that can serve a particular purpose.
Software Engineering is the process of designing, developing, testing and maintaining a software

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase. 1. Problem identification - at this stage inputs from all stakeholders, customers, industry experts, programmers learn the strenghts and weakness of the current system with improvement as a goal. 2. Plan - at this stage the SDLC team determines the cost and ressources reqired for implementing the analyzed problem. 3. Design - at this phase the SDLC team start to turn the software specification into design plan called the design specification. 4. Building - at this stage the actual development starts where each developer sticks to the agreed blueprint. 5. Testing - at this stage the sofware is tested for defects and deficiencies. 6. Deployment - at this stage the software is deployed so that users can start using the product. 7. Maintenance - at this stage the software is monitored and updated.

Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred? 1. Process flow - Agile is iterative and cynical while waterfall is linear 2. Flexibility - Agile is highly adaptable to changes while waterfall is rigid with difficult changes to implement once phase is complete. 3. Customer inputs - Agile requires continous customer involvement while Waterfall customer involvement is limited after the initial requirements are gathered. 4. Documentation - Agile requires less emphasis on documentation more on working software while Waterfall has a high emphasis on documentation at each stage. 5. Testing - Agile requires continous testing while Waterfall testing phase follows after developmentis completed. 6. Team structure - Agile is self-organizing and cross-functional for teams while Waterfall teams are typically work in silos based on their specific phase expertise

    - Agile is prefered for projects that require flexibility, fast delivery, and continous customers feedbacks best for complex and evolving projects.
    - Waterfall is prefered for projects with well defined requirements and clear, unchanging goals. is best for projects where detailed documentation and structure approach are necessary.

Requirements Engineering:
What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Requirements Engineering is the process of identifying, eliciting, analyzing, specifying, validating, and managing the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system.

    PROCESS:
    (i). Feasibility study - is an assessment of the practicality and potential success of a proposed project. It evaluates various factors to determine whether the project is viable and worth pursuing.
    (ii). Requirement elicitation - is the process of gathering information about the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system.
    (iii). Requirement specification - is the process of documenting the requirements identified in the analysis step in a clear, consistent, and unambiguous manner.
    (iv). Requirement verification and validation - verification refers to the set of tasks that ensures that the software correctly implements a specific function. validation refers to a different set of tasks that ensures that the software that has been built is traceable to customer requirements
    (v). Requirement management - is the process of analyzing, documenting, tracking, prioritizing, and agreeing on the requirement and controlling the communication with relevant stakeholders. This stage takes care of the changing nature of requirements. It should be ensured that the SRS is as modifiable as possible to incorporate changes in requirements specified by the end users at later stages too.

Software Design Principles:
Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Modularity in software design is a technique where complex software is divided into smaller, independent modules, such as functions, classes, or components. It facilitates easier management and understanding of complex systems by breaking them down into digestible parts.
It improves maintainability and scalability dividing software into distinct modules, developers can manage, update, and scale parts of the application independently, leading to more efficient maintenance and easier scalability.

Testing in Software Engineering:
Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development? 1. Unit testing - it involves testing individual components or units of code (usually functions or methods) in isolation to ensure they work correctly. 2. Integration testing - done to examine the interaction between different units or components to ensure they work together correctly. 3. System testing - done to valuates the complete and integrated software system to ensure it meets the specified requirements. 4. Acceptance testing - is conducted to determine if the software is ready for release and meets the business needs and requirements.
Testing is crucial in system developement as it helps in detecting and fixing defects early in the development stage, regukar testing ensures the software performs reliably, it ensures that the software meets the specificied requirements and it enhances security as it can be used to ie=dentify vulnerabilities.

Version Control Systems:
What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
version control systems (vsc) are tools that help manage changes to source code over time. They track revisions, facilitate collaboration among developers, and ensure that the entire history of changes is preserved. This enables teams to work on software projects more efficiently and with greater control over the development process.

    Importance:
    1. the enable collaboration among team members enabling multiple developers to work on the same project.
    2. the enable in tracking changes and the person who made them for accountability
    3. Reverting changes this is undoing a mistake when a bug occurs developers can revert to previous stable version.
    4. Backup and recovery incase of local machine failure the code can be retrieved since it is safely store.
    5. Code integrit by ensuring the codebase remains conssistent and functional through out various changes.

    Examples of version control and their features
    1. Git it is a distributed vcs and has the following features; branching and merging, staging area.
    2. Subversion it is a centralized vcs and has this features atomic commits, directory versioning, access control, merging and conflict resolution
    3. Mercurial it is a distributed vcs and has the following features branching, extensibility, simplicity and perfomance
    4. Perforce it is a centralized vcs features include; high performance,file locking, access control,integration
